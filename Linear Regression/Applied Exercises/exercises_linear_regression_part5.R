'''
This problem focuses on the collinearity problem.

set.seed(1)
x1=runif (100)
x2=0.5*x1+rnorm (100)/10
y=2+2*x1+0.3*x2+rnorm (100)
'''
The last line corresponds to creating a linear model in which y is
a function of x1 and x2. Write out the form of the linear model.
What are the regression coefficients?
'''
#Y=2+2X1+0.3X2+ϵ
#β0=2,β1=2,β3=0.3
'''
Using this data, fit a least squares regression to predict y using
x1 and x2. Describe the results obtained. What are βˆ0, βˆ1, and
βˆ2? How do these relate to the true β0, β1, and β2? Can you
reject the null hypothesis H0 : β1 = 0? How about the null
hypothesis H0 : β2 = 0?
'''
lm.fit = lm(y~x1+x2)
summary(lm.fit)
'''
 Now fit a least squares regression to predict y using only x1.
Comment on your results. Can you reject the null hypothesis
H0 : β1 = 0?
'''
lm.fit = lm(y~x1)
